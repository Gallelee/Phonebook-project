Gallelee's Phonebook

This is a simple program to lookup phone numbers associated with names quickly and vice versa.
#Usage details
    To use it, simply create a text file and in the form of:
    (lastname) (firstname) (the # of phone numbers to be stored) (the description of the number ie mobile) (and the phone number in the form of (xxx)xxx-xxxx )
    The program must be fed a file path as a command line argument. Otherwise it will default to the file "DefaultPhoneBook.txt".
#Current limitations
    Be sure to exclude all parenthesis besides the ones used for the area code of the number.
    There are also no middle initials allowed.

Each class contains some logic that can be used in other projects for further versatility but have not been used here.
